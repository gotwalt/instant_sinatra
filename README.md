Instant Sinatra
===============
Just a simple Sinatra app boilerplate I whipped together that plays nicely with RVM and Bundler. Easily adaptable to whatever need you may have for a lightweight ruby app environment. Contains both a config.ru for usage with rack-compliant app servers and a Unicorn configuration file for semi-serious situations.

Requirements
------------
* RVM (there's a .rvmrc in the repo)
* Ruby 1.9.2 (will work in 1.8.7 as well, but prefer 1.9.2)
* Bundler (http://gembundler.com)
